# Simple-Script-Scheduler
A lightweight and user-friendly Python-based GUI tool to schedule the execution of `.exe`, `.sh`, `.bat`, or `.py` script files at recurring intervals (Daily, Weekly, Monthly). The tool runs quietly in the system tray and continues execution until the system is restarted or the app is explicitly exited.
